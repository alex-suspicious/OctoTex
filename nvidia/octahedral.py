# Converts either OpenGL or DirectX style normal maps to RTX Remix compatible Hemispherical Octahedral maps.
#
# Note that normals pointing in to the surface are not physically possible, and are not supported by RTX Remix.
#   Any images with inward pointing normals will generate a warning and will be flipped to point outwards.
#
# There is a good explanation of DirectX vs OpenGL normal maps at
#   https://www.texturecan.com/post/3/DirectX-vs-OpenGL-Normal-Map/
#
# To use, call this from python as
# `LightspeedOctahedralConverter.convert_dx_file_to_octahedral("input_dx_normal_map.png", "output_octahedral_map.png")`
#
# To then load these into RTX Remix, you can convert it to a DDS file using
#   https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-exporter
#   Use BC5 compression, and the flag --no-mip-gamma-correct
